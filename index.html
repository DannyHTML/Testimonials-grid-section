              &#8220; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
              I&#700;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
              people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
              free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
              thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
              time of my life. Since completing the course, I&#700;ve
              successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
              VR startup. &#8221;

              &#8220; Before joining the bootcamp, I&#700;ve never written a
              line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
              help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
              by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
              about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
              disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
              for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
              no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&#700;ve often referred to
              it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
              certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! &#8221;
